# spotifyc

Mostly a wrapper around playerctl, with a few extra features ðŸ˜‰

## Features [in no specific order]
 - Basic track control:
    ```sh
    $ spotifyc [-c|-p|-n|-r|-s]
    ```
        -c: toggle play/pause state
        -p: previous track
        -n: next track
        -r: play [why r?! resume]
        -s: pause [why s?! stop]


 - Control spotify's volume:
    ```sh
    $ spotifyc -v [m|u|t|abs|+-rel]
    ```
        m: mute
        u: unmute
        t: toggle mute state
        abs: set spotify's volume to abs
        +/-rel: adjust spotify's volume by rel


 - Get formatted output for status bars like [polybar](https://github.com/polybar/polybar),
    [i3blocks](https://github.com/vivien/i3blocks), etc
    (basically any status bar which allows you to run a script)
    ```sh
    $ spotifyc -f '<format>' -i '<playing>' '<paused>' -o
    ```
        -f '<format>': specify the format of output
                        [see formatting options below]
        -i '<playing>' '<paused>': specify the icons to be displayed when
                                    song is playing or is paused repectively
        -o: prints the output in the specified format [defaults to '{{ artist }}: {{ title }}'

 - Mute ads on spotify and play some other song stored locally.

    ```sh
    $ spotifyc -m '<alt_music_dir>'
    ```
        -m: mutes ads on spotify
        if provided, songs present in 'alt_music_dir' will be played

    __NOTE__: make sure only one instance is running at a time
    [you don't want 2 different songs playing whenever an ad comes]

    ### How to run?
    If you simply run this command, it will block your shell.
    Add an `&` at the end to run this in background.
    Ideally place this in some file while which runs when you log in [not `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`].
    In the standard case, `~/.profile` should work.

    ### Inspiration
    Spotify ads which complain about how ads on Spotify are bad and irritating

## Formatting output
This uses playerctl to display metadata. So, it supports all options which playerctl does. 
Check `man playerctl` to see all options and modifiers.

Other than that, it also uses '{{ icon }}' which is used to display the icons specified by `-i|--icons`

## Requirements
This requires [playerctl](https://github.com/acrisci/playerctl), pactl(pulseaudio), python3 and vlc bindings for python3

    pip3 install python-vlc

## Issues
Please create issues on [GitHub](https://github.com/YoogottamK/spotifyc/issues)

## Note
This project was created just for fun. If you really like Spotify and hate ads, consider paying for the premium account.
